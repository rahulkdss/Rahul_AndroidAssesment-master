- Kotlin: The primary programming language for Android development, known for its conciseness, safety features, and interoperability with Java.
  
- Android Jetpack Components:
  
- ViewModel: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, surviving configuration changes and providing data to the UI.
  
- LiveData: Provides observable data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes, ensuring data consistency and efficient UI updates.
  
- MVVM Clean Architecture: Organizes the codebase following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, adhering to clean architecture principles for separation of concerns and maintainability.
  
- Room: A robust SQLite database library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to perform database operations seamlessly and efficiently, supporting offline data storage and retrieval.
  
- Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for making network requests in Android apps, facilitating easy communication with RESTful APIs and handling response parsing.
  
- Dagger 2 : Dependency injection frameworks for managing dependencies in your application and promoting modular architecture.
  
- Coroutines: Kotlin's lightweight concurrency framework for asynchronous programming, enabling the efficient and structured management of background tasks and asynchronous operations.
  
- RecyclerView: A powerful UI component for displaying large datasets efficiently by recycling item views, improving performance and memory efficiency compared to traditional list views.
  
- ConstraintLayout: A flexible and efficient layout manager that allows the creation of complex UIs with a flat view hierarchy, supporting responsive and dynamic UI designs across different screen sizes and orientations.
